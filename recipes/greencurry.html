        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put 225g new potatoes, cut into chunks, in a pan of boiling water and cook for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 100g trimmed and halved green beans and cook for a further 3 minutes, by which time both should be just tender but not too soft. Drain and put to one side. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In a wok or large frying pan, heat 1 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil until very hot, then drop in 1 chopped garlic clove and cook until golden, this should take only a few seconds. Donâ€™t let it go very dark or it will spoil the taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon in 1 rounded tbsp Thai green curry paste and stir it around for a few seconds to begin to cook the spices and release all the flavours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, pour in a 400ml can of coconut milk and let it come to a bubble.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in 2 tsp Thai fish sauce and 1 tsp caster sugar, then 450g bite-size chicken pieces. Turn the heat down to a simmer and cook, covered, for about 8 minutes until the chicken is cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tip in the potatoes and beans and let them warm through in the hot coconut milk, then add 2 finely shredded lime leaves (or 3 wide strips lime zest).
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a good handful basil leaves, but only leave them briefly on the heat or they will quickly lose their brightness.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scatter with lime to garnish and serve immediately with boiled rice.
            </li>
        </ol>
