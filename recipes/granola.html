        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                3 cups rolled oats
            </li>
            <li>
                1 cup chopped raw nuts
            </li>
            <li>
                2 tbsp of chia seeds
            </li>
            <li>
                3 tbsp coconut or organic cane sugar
            </li>
            <li>
                1 tbsp sea salt
            </li>
            <li>
                1/3 cup cocoa powder
            </li>
            <li>
                1/4 cup coconut oil
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 cup maple syrup
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 cup dark chocolate chips or chunks
            </li>
            </ul>
            
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 340 degrees F (171 C).
                </li>
                <li>
                    To a food processor (or mixing bowl), add the oats, nuts, coconut, chia seeds, coconut sugar, salt, and cocoa powder. Pulse a few times (or stir) to combine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, warm the coconut oil and maple syrup until melted and combined. Pour over the dry ingredients and mix or stir well. If using a food processor, this breaks down the oats and nuts a bit more so itâ€™s a finer texture, but this is optional.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spread the mixture evenly onto a baking sheet (or more baking sheets if making a larger batch) and bake for 17-24 minutes (or until fragrant and deep golden brown), stirring a bit near the halfway point to ensure even baking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let cool completely. Then add chocolate (optional). Place in a container that has an air-tight seal, and it should keep for a few weeks. Or store in the freezer up to 1 month or longer.
                </li>
            </ol>
